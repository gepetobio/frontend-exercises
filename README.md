# Frontend challenges

I'm coming up with some challenges to the true frontend dev. Let me start saying that I have some reservations with someone says: "I'm a fullstack developer" and that's how these challenges came to life.

I'll be adding simple challenges frequently here and there are some rules for that:

1. All challenges need to be done on jsbin.com
2. You can use w3schools.com
2. You shouldn't even use google to do the challenges
3. If you use google, you have to keep track of what you searched for and save the links you used
4. You should track the time you spend on each challenge
5. Send me a message with the link of the jsbin you created (and your searches and links used, if you cheated)
6. Be happy!

I'm still thinking about the best way to check your results... not convinced email will be the way to go :P
